        <p>With <b>three years</b> of experience in HTML, I have honed my skills in crafting responsive and user-friendly web pages.
        Throughout this period, I have successfully completed over six projects, each highlighting my ability to create
        structured, accessible, and visually appealing content. These projects range from personal blogs to dynamic web
        applications, showcasing my proficiency in HTML as well as my understanding of web design principles and best practices.
        This extensive hands-on experience has solidified my expertise and adaptability in front-end web development.</p>
