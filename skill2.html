        <h2 class="heading">CSS Skills:</h2>
        <p>With <b>three years</b> of experience in CSS, I have developed a keen eye for design and a strong command over styling web
        pages to ensure they are both aesthetically pleasing and functional. Over this time, I have completed more than six
        projects, demonstrating my ability to create visually compelling layouts and seamless user interfaces. These projects
        include intricate designs for personal blogs, e-commerce sites, and dynamic web applications, all of which emphasize my
        expertise in CSS. This experience has refined my skills in responsive design, cross-browser compatibility, and modern
        CSS techniques.</p>
