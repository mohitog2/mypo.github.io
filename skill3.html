        <p>With <b>two years</b> of experience in JavaScript, I have gained a deep understanding of creating interactive and dynamic web
        applications. Throughout this period, I have completed over six projects that showcase my ability to implement complex
        functionalities and enhance user experiences. These projects range from interactive forms and data visualizations to
        full-fledged single-page applications, demonstrating my proficiency in JavaScript as well as my familiarity with various
        frameworks and libraries. This hands-on experience has sharpened my skills in writing efficient, maintainable code and
        solving real-world problems through innovative web solutions.</p>
