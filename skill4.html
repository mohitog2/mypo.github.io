        <p>With <b>three years</b>of experience in Java, I have developed a robust understanding of object-oriented programming and a
        strong ability to build scalable, high-performance applications. During this time, I have completed over six projects,
        demonstrating my proficiency in developing complex backend systems, desktop applications, and Android apps. These
        projects include e-commerce platforms, management systems, and mobile applications, all highlighting my expertise in
        Java. This extensive experience has refined my skills in writing efficient code, optimizing performance, and
        implementing best practices for software development.</p>
