        <p>With <b>one year</b> of experience in React.js, I’ve developed a strong foundation in building responsive and dynamic web
        applications. This journey has enhanced my skills in JavaScript, component-based architecture, and state management. I’m
        comfortable working with hooks, API integration, and creating efficient, scalable front-end solutions.</p>
